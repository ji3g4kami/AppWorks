 /*
 1.In swift, we define a variable through the syntax below.
 ​var​ x: ​Int​ = ​10
 That’s practice this syntax :
 When mentioning about calculating circle’s area, we use the formula:  2 * radius * PI  to get area.
 Now, please define a variable  PI  and assign value to it.
 You can refer to the syntax above.
 But think clearly about using var or let and which data type you should choose.

let PI: Double = 3.14159265
