/*
 4.Swift is a very powerful language.
 It can infer the data type for you ( Type inference ).
 But we still need to know the basic theory.
 Please mark the data type in the following statement:
 Ex: var​ x = ​10​​ => var​ x: ​Int​ = ​10
 var​ flag = ​true
 var inputString = ​"Hello world."
 let​ bitsInBite = ​8
 let​ averageScore = ​86.8
 */
var flag: Bool = true
var inputString: String = "Hello world."
let bitsInBite: Int = 8
let averageScore: Double = 86.8
